# Project Proposal

## Project Description
For my final project, I'd like to create an application that will allow the user to choose an image on their computer and manipulate the image, such as apply filters.  If I have time, I want to have the application take in video camera feed and apply filters to the current image, and maybe do something with facial recognition and applying Snapchat-like filters on a user's face. I don't have any specific background I believe will help me with this other than being briefly exposed to openCV at the beginning of this year.

## openFrameworks addons needed:
* ofxGui
* ofxOpenCv
